### Functionality and MVP

1. Users can create, edit, and save (if logged in) teams of 6 Pokemon
2. Browse, search by name, or filter by type to easily find Pokemon to put on team
3. Pokemon teams are analyzed and important information (Statistics, strengths, and weaknesses) is displayed intuitively
4. Pokemon teams are displayed on a social feed for others to explore and like.
5. A user's profile contains their public information, created teams, and liked teams.

```
   //filter code
   filterPokemon(...filters){
        const newFilter = filters[0] && filters[1] ? filters : filters[0] ? [filters[0]] : filters[1] ? [filters[1]] : [];
        
        this.setState((state, props) => {
            const pokemon = !newFilter.length ? Object.values(props.pokemon) : Object.values(props.pokemon).filter(poke => {
                return !!poke.types && newFilter.every(filter => poke.types.includes(filter));
            });
            return { pokemon };
        });
    }

    async filterByType(filter, type){
        const filters = Object.assign(this.state);
        filters[filter] = type;

        const { typeFilter1, typeFilter2 } = filters;
        
            if (typeFilter1 && !typeFilter2) {
                await this.props.fetchByType(typeFilter1);
                this.filterPokemon(typeFilter1, typeFilter2);      
            } else if (!typeFilter1 && typeFilter2) {
                await this.props.fetchByType(typeFilter2);
                this.filterPokemon(typeFilter1, typeFilter2);   
            } else if (typeFilter1 && typeFilter2) {
                await this.props.fetchByType(typeFilter1).then(() => this.props.fetchByType(typeFilter2));
                this.filterPokemon(typeFilter1, typeFilter2);
            } else {
                this.filterPokemon(typeFilter1, typeFilter2);
            }
    }
